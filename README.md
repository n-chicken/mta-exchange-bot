# MTA Exchange v2 Bot

## Commands

- `/auction <list|add>`

- `/search <item id|item name>` - should be able to list all

- `/list <user>` - lists all registered information about a user, including their current pitches, 

- `/buying`

## Roles

- Unverified
- Trusted (has at least one transaction confirmed by other verified member)

## To-do/Issues:

- Create better help command & clarify command structure
- Should "shops" be a thing?
- Add autocomplete in contexts where item ids are possible arguments
