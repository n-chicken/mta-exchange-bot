## Roles

- Unverified
- Trusted (has at least one transaction confirmed by other verified member)

## To-do/Issues:

- Create better help command & clarify command structure
- Should "shops" be a thing?
- Add autocomplete in contexts where item ids are possible arguments
  - Maybe include popular kits?
